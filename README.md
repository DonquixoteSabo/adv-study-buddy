## Overview

![screenshot](https://www.datocms-assets.com/64388/1651770227-dziennnik_mock_up_jpg.jpg)
At the very beginning, this project was a part of a react course made by "Hello Roman" on youtube. After a while, I
decided to recreate this project with new features and brand new technologies. The only think that remain the same is
color branding and dashboard design. It is an electronic diary that teachers can use to organize their&nbsp students.
The user can modify classes, notes, and students with pop-up modals. Every single feature in this app was tested with
React Testing Library or Cypress.
